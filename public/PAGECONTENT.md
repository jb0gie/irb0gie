## Ship app component

### (Ship section 1 start modal)

**_brief description of case study_**

My manager approached me asking if we had the capability to develop apps.
Having experience developing native android apps prior, I jumped at the oppurtunity to get some more practice in as well as show off what we were capable of.

### (Ship section 2 start proj overview)

two cols layout

**_col1: Project Overview_**

The project was to develop a native android app detailing the Royal Navy Ship.
I was provided with an initial .pdf showing all the differnet ships and some interesting facts about each of them.
The goal of Ship app is to provide new naval personnel or any civillians interested, a neat way to learn about the Ship on the go.

**_col2: My Role_**

I was the only person that worked directly under my manager.
I did although get some input from my collegues, the entirety of the project was my responisblity,
as I was the only one with any prior android development experience.
I was also responsible for the branding and visual design as well as making sure the product upheld the company and customer branding gudelines.

### (Ship section 3 start the problem)

**_talk about the problem_**
Technology continues to advance and innovate our lives, impacting almost every area of it. Working in training I have seen clear evidence of this. When I first started, I didn't fully understand how technology was impacting training. Then when I started seeing more and more different examples of 'new media' come out, things like mixed reality. I knew then that learning the process that goes into native solutions would be a essential skill in my toolset to have. So I did. The Royal Navy recieves new trainees quite regularly. So being able to deliver learning content that will ensure a high efficient level of training possible is very important. Training is an ever evolving thing, this means for people like me being adaptable is crucial.

The project was to develop a native android app detailing the Royal Navy Ship.
I was provided with an initial .pdf showing all the differnet ships and some interesting facts about each of them.
The goal of Ship app is to provide new naval personnel or any civillians interested, a neat way to learn about the Ship on the go.
So with my references in tow, I went to the internet.

**_p2: coming up with a workflow / research_**

The first thing I started looking for were any examples of new innovative ways to display content natively.
I searched for different types of layouts such as grid layouts, navigation sidebar etc.
After I had caught up with the current design trends, I then began to start visualalising what I would eventually create.
I threw any and every idea I had down for future reference aswell as any spur of the moment quirkiness that popped into my head.

## Rule of the road component

### (ror section 1 start)

**_brief description of case study_**

To keep the the customer's attention in our line of sight, often times a new type of something is brought forward to the table and intoduced in a attempt to gain buy in.
So when I began hearing talks about creating something completely different, lightbulbs started lighting up.

### (ror section 2 start)

two cols layout

**_col1: Project Overview_**
Rule of the Road is the highway code for sea.
Every sailor must complete this before being allowed to sail.
After some research into how the RN ensure all their sailors are up to scratch, we found out that there wasn't anything but the actual book and a written exam at the end.
In a sense this was a good thing for us, as we were essentially starting off with a blank canvas.
**_col2: My Role_**
There were 3 of us initially including myself that conceptualised this idea, although the whole office and various other departments put their input in along the way.
This project took about just under a year to complete.

### (ror section 3 start)

**_talk about the problem_**
According to the RN there wasn't a problem with how they train currently.
We just saw an opputunity to innovate.
By allowing trainees to be put into a situtation that would normally endanger their lives, we can ensure that if and when they did get put into a situation they are properly prepared.
We also looked into other areas of training that have been positively impacted by implementing gameified solutions, and our findings were rather promising.

### (ror section 4 start)

**_tell a story about the project_**

**_p1: how it intitally start_**
It all started with Unity3d.
When I discorvered the potential Unity3d offered to someone like me, let's just say.. I was taken back.
I truly feel I honed my craft with this project, I bell curved my skills.
Going from an adept 2D motion graphics and film background into the world of 3d grpahics.
I learnt how to model, uv map, texture, rig and animate scenes.
This project was also the first time I every did anything with Unity3d.

**_p2: coming up with a workflow / research_**
Seeing as this project was a first of it's kind, we decided to maintain a more fluid approach.
By having frequent weekly meetings, we managed to stay on top of this ever changing project.
And although at times it was mildly frustrating to have worked on something one week to only scrap it the next to then only take it out of bin again.
It was a bit overwhelming researching various subjects so erractically.
But after a few weeks of researching which software would fit with our needs, how we were going to to deliver learning/training and ensuring we maintained a strong level of continuity with the orginal source material.

Not too long we finnaly felt confident with the direction we were going with.
After great deliberation and thought, we decided that Unity3d was best platform for us to build on as there were memebers on the team that were quite knowledgeable.
There were a lot of moving parts to juggle for this project and I feel working on this project really boosted my competancy for digesting information and applying it.
I remember, one of our early challenges was to get water buoyancy working. It was also a challange to recreate Portsmouth harbour which we chose to base this concept on.

## Namc component

### (namc section 1 start)

**_brief description of case study_**
The customer often approaches us asking what we would consider 'the impossible'.
One of our jobs is to take the impossible and make it possible.

### (namc section 2 start)

two cols layout

**_col1: Project Overview_**
By making a working replica of the equipment on board any given ship, trainees can see first hand what they are fixing etc.
This method gives trainees a glimpse into a potential situation, and while I feel this method of training is very effective.
I also feel now that technology has progressed, a more accessible solution can be achieved.
And that what this project was about, innovation and optimisation.

**_col2: My Role_**
I was the only individual tasked to this project.
I liased with a subject matter expert and course trainers often to gain feedback as well as try to come up with intuitive ways to benefit their training.

### (namc section 3 start)

**_talk about the problem_**

Like an office, ships in the RN Ship often run into computer troubles.
Luckily there are always staff trained to combat any IT problems.
But the actual traning itself is slow and there is definitlely room for improvment.
For example server repair training is held in a classoom.
Trainees are limited to actual hands on training due to outdated infrastructure.
One part of the lesson takes 2 hours and 30 minutes to complete for 1 person to complete.
As the course currently stood it was effective but didn't scale well.
It took too much time in short, and due to the nature of the business.
That meant money could be saved on training.
So it was up to me to come up with a more effcient solution.

### (namc section 4 start)

**_tell a story about the project_**

**_p1: how it intitally start_**
It all started when we were approached by the customer.
They told us about this server repair course that they thought we could be improved.
After a couple meetings, I realsied there was a way to improve this course.
What if we recreated the repair process, we could cut down the training time and not only that.
We could also allow more than on trainee to learn the repair process.
**_p2: coming up with a workflow / research_**
After hearing about the course from the trainer, I went over to where the course was taught to gain a better understanding.
Then for reference I filmed the repair process.
Then I began to research different ways I would go about developing.
